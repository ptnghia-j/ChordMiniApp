# NPM Configuration for ChordMiniApp
# This file ensures consistent npm behavior across all environments (local, CI/CD, Docker)

# Use legacy peer dependency resolution to handle HeroUI/Tailwind CSS version conflict
# HeroUI 2.4.26+ requires Tailwind CSS 4.0+, but we use Tailwind CSS 3.x
# This allows npm to install packages despite peer dependency conflicts
legacy-peer-deps=true

# Disable package-lock changes during install (useful for CI)
# Uncomment if you want stricter lockfile behavior:
# save-exact=true

# Engine strict mode - fail if Node.js version doesn't match
# engine-strict=true
