# Vercel GitHub Actions Configuration Fix

## üîç Problem Identified

Your GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline is failing with:
```
Error: Project not found ({"VERCEL_PROJECT_ID":"***","VERCEL_ORG_ID":"***"})
```

**Root Cause**: The GitHub repository secrets don't match your current Vercel project configuration.

## ‚úÖ Correct Configuration Values

**Your Local Configuration (Verified Working):**
- **Project ID**: `prj_juBDUx8mBtBTcqg6Sk4VY4g1AmBy`
- **Organization ID**: `team_oTF27tpKvXhJr3dJ1rFgDENU`
- **Team Name**: `chord-mini1`
- **Project Name**: `chord-mini-app`
- **Production URL**: `https://www.chordmini.me`

## üõ†Ô∏è Fix Required: Update GitHub Secrets

### Step 1: Access GitHub Repository Secrets

1. Go to: https://github.com/ptnghia-j/ChordMiniApp/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click on **Actions** under "Secrets and variables"

### Step 2: Update These Secrets

**Set or update these exact values:**

```
Secret Name: VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
Secret Value: prj_juBDUx8mBtBTcqg6Sk4VY4g1AmBy

Secret Name: VERCEL_ORG_ID  
Secret Value: team_oTF27tpKvXhJr3dJ1rFgDENU

Secret Name: VERCEL_TOKEN
Secret Value: [Your Vercel API Token - see Step 3]
```

### Step 3: Get/Refresh Vercel Token (if needed)

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/account/tokens
2. Click "Create Token"
3. Name it: "GitHub Actions ChordMiniApp"
4. Set scope to your team: `chord-mini1`
5. Copy the token and add it as `VERCEL_TOKEN` secret

## üß™ Verification

### Local Verification (‚úÖ Already Working)
```bash
# These commands work locally:
vercel pull --yes --environment=production  # ‚úÖ Success
vercel project inspect chord-mini-app        # ‚úÖ Success
vercel whoami                               # ‚úÖ phantrongnghia510-2083
```

### GitHub Actions Verification
After updating the secrets, your GitHub Actions should work with these commands:
```bash
vercel pull --yes --environment=production --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
vercel build --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod --token=${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
```

## üìã Current GitHub Actions Workflow

Your workflow file `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` is correctly configured and will work once the secrets are updated:

- ‚úÖ Uses correct environment variables: `VERCEL_ORG_ID` and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
- ‚úÖ Has proper deployment steps for both preview and production
- ‚úÖ Includes security scanning and post-deployment verification
- ‚úÖ Has comprehensive error handling and notifications

## üöÄ Expected Results After Fix

Once you update the GitHub secrets:

1. **‚úÖ Preview Deployments**: Will work for pull requests
2. **‚úÖ Production Deployments**: Will work for main branch pushes  
3. **‚úÖ Security Scans**: Will continue to pass (0 vulnerabilities)
4. **‚úÖ Environment Variables**: Will be properly pulled from Vercel
5. **‚úÖ Build Process**: Will use correct project configuration

## üîß Quick Fix Checklist

- [ ] Update `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` secret to: `prj_juBDUx8mBtBTcqg6Sk4VY4g1AmBy`
- [ ] Update `VERCEL_ORG_ID` secret to: `team_oTF27tpKvXhJr3dJ1rFgDENU`
- [ ] Verify `VERCEL_TOKEN` secret exists and is valid
- [ ] Test by pushing a commit or creating a pull request
- [ ] Monitor GitHub Actions workflow for successful deployment

## üìû Support

If you continue to have issues after updating the secrets:

1. Check that the Vercel token has the correct permissions for the `chord-mini1` team
2. Verify the token hasn't expired
3. Ensure the project is still accessible under the `chord-mini1` team
4. Run the verification script: `./scripts/verify-vercel-config.sh`

**Status**: Ready to fix - just need to update the GitHub secrets with the correct values above.
