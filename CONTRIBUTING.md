# Contributing to ChordMini

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ChordMini! This guide will help you get started with contributing to our AI-powered chord recognition application.

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Standards
- **Strict Mode**: All TypeScript strict checks enabled
- **Type Safety**: Avoid `any` types, use proper interfaces and type definitions
- **Naming Conventions**:
  - PascalCase for components and interfaces
  - camelCase for variables and functions
  - UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants

### React/Next.js Best Practices
- **Components**: Use functional components with hooks
- **File Structure**: Group related components in feature folders
- **Imports**: Use absolute imports with `@/` prefix
- **Props**: Define explicit interfaces for all component props

### Styling Guidelines
- **Tailwind CSS**: Use utility classes, avoid custom CSS when possible
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints
- **Dark Mode**: Support both light and dark themes consistently
- **Accessibility**: Include proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

### ESLint Configuration
Follow the existing ESLint rules:
```bash
npm run lint        # Check for linting errors
npm run lint:fix    # Auto-fix linting issues
```

## üß™ Testing

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Jest + React Testing Library for component testing
- **Integration Tests**: API route testing with mock services
- **E2E Tests**: Playwright for critical user flows
- **Performance Tests**: Lighthouse CI for performance monitoring

### Running Tests
```bash
npm run test        # Run unit tests
npm run test:watch  # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:e2e    # Run end-to-end tests
npm run build       # Verify production build
```

### Test Requirements
- **Coverage**: Maintain >80% test coverage for new features
- **Critical Paths**: All user-facing features must have tests
- **API Routes**: All API endpoints must have integration tests
- **Components**: UI components must have accessibility tests

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
1. **Fork and Branch**: Create a feature branch from `main`
2. **Code Quality**: Ensure all tests pass and linting is clean
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
4. **Build Verification**: Run `npm run build` successfully

### PR Requirements
- **Descriptive Title**: Clear, concise description of changes
- **Detailed Description**: Include motivation, changes, and testing notes
- **Issue Reference**: Link to related GitHub issues
- **Screenshots**: Include before/after screenshots for UI changes
- **Breaking Changes**: Clearly document any breaking changes

### Review Process
1. **Automated Checks**: All CI/CD checks must pass
2. **Code Review**: At least one maintainer review required
3. **Testing**: Manual testing for complex features
4. **Documentation**: Ensure documentation is updated

### Merge Criteria
- ‚úÖ All tests passing
- ‚úÖ Code review approved
- ‚úÖ No merge conflicts
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated
- ‚úÖ Performance impact assessed
