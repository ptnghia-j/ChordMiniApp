# Chord Recognition System - Task Tracking and Implementation Plan

This document tracks the implementation progress of the chord recognition system. The project will follow a multi-sprint development cycle with continuous delivery. Each sprint will be 2 weeks long. The continuous delivery pipeline will consist of the following stages:

1. Code Commit
2. CI Build
3. Artifact Creation
4. Environment Deployment
5. Automated Testing
6. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
7. Production Deployment
8. Monitoring

## Implementation Progress Notes

- **T001**: Basic Next.js setup complete with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. Project structure established with routing.
- **T003**: Created YouTube API configuration, implemented search functionality, and URL parsing. Requires a real API key for full functionality.
- **T004**: Implemented audio extraction service with server-side API route for processing YouTube videos. Added caching to store processed audio for reuse, improving performance and reducing processing time. The audio extraction now happens automatically when a video is loaded.
- **T005**: Created a chord recognition service with placeholder implementation. Currently using mock data for development, with the infrastructure ready for integrating a real ML model. Added chord analysis visualization and synchronization with playback.
- **T006**: Implemented beat detection service with placeholder implementation. Set up the structure for beat tracking and synchronization with video playback. Need to replace with a real ML model.
- **T007**: Started implementing the data processing pipeline that combines chord and beat detection. Added functionality to synchronize chords with beats and display results in real-time during playback.
- **T008**: Enhanced home page with search input, YouTube search results display, and navigation to analysis page. Now handles both direct URLs and search terms.
- **T009**: Created analysis page layout with functional YouTube player integration using react-youtube. Implemented playback controls (play/pause, speed adjustment) and progress tracking.
- **T010**: Enhanced chord grid component with visual styling based on chord types (major/minor/etc) and highlighting of the current beat during playback. Uses a grid layout for better visualization.
