## Implementation Progress Notes

- **T001**: âœ… Next.js project successfully initialized with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. Project structure established with routing and proper configuration.
- **T002**: âœ… Firebase integration completed with Firestore database setup for caching transcription results. Implemented services for storing and retrieving transcription data, with proper error handling and fallback mechanisms.
- **T003**: âœ… YouTube API integration completed with search functionality, video metadata retrieval, and URL parsing. API endpoints implemented for searching YouTube and retrieving video data.
- **T004**: âœ… Audio extraction service fully implemented with server-side API route for processing YouTube videos. Added caching system to store processed audio for reuse, significantly improving performance and reducing processing time. The audio extraction now happens automatically when a video is loaded.
- **T005**: âœ… Chord recognition service implemented and integrated with the frontend. The service analyzes audio files and identifies chord progressions, with visualization and synchronization with playback.
- **T006**: âœ… Beat detection service implemented with support for multiple models (librosa, madmom, beat-transformer). Added beat tracking and synchronization with video playback. The system now supports different time signatures and outputs BPM information.
- **T007**: âœ… Data processing pipeline completed, combining chord and beat detection. Added functionality to synchronize chords with beats and display results in real-time during playback. The pipeline now handles caching to avoid reprocessing videos.
- **T008**: âœ… Home page completed with search input, YouTube search results display, and navigation to analysis page. The interface now handles both direct URLs and search terms with proper error handling.
- **T009**: âœ… Analysis page fully implemented with YouTube player integration, playback controls (play/pause, speed adjustment), and progress tracking. Added responsive design with floating video player for mobile devices.
- **T010**: âœ… Chord grid component completed with visual styling based on chord types, highlighting of the current beat during playback, and auto-scrolling functionality. The grid now has a clean, minimalist design with proper spacing and responsive layout.
- **T012**: ðŸ”„ Performance optimization in progress. Implemented caching for audio files and analysis results. Fixed TypeScript errors and improved code quality. Working on optimizing the audio processing pipeline.
- **T013**: ðŸ”„ UI/UX improvements in progress. Implemented responsive design for the YouTube video player, improved chord grid visualization, and added auto-scrolling functionality. Working on additional visual enhancements and animations.
- **T014**: ðŸ”„ Error handling improvements in progress. Fixed TypeScript errors, improved error handling in audio processing, and added better user feedback for processing states. Working on handling edge cases and improving error messages.
