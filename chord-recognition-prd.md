   - Solution: Implement caching and rate limiting to stay within API quotas

4. **Real-time Synchronization**
   - Challenge: Ensuring chord display is perfectly synchronized with audio playback
   - Solution: Use precise timing mechanisms and consider pre-computing synchronization data

5. **Mobile Experience**
   - Challenge: Providing a good experience on mobile devices with limited screen space
